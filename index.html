        <h3>Term Project Description</h3>
        <p>I developed a Water Remider Application with two other teammates this semester aiming to help users maintain their hydration levels given that everyone ignores one's health due to their busy lives and routines. The goal is to integrate the application with existing health-tracking applications and devices, providing users with personalized hydration goals and reminders. This application not only serves users with their hydration needs but also showcases my ability to manage a project from conception to deployment. I am convinced that this application has a greater scope in the coming future on health management.</p>
